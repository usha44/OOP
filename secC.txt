secC a. Java Class and Object
A class is like a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. 
It contains variables (attributes) and methods (functions). 
An object is an instance of a class that holds real data. 
For example, if Car is a class, then a specific car like "Honda" is an object of that class. 
We can create multiple objects from one class.

b. Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading in Java means having more than one constructor in the same class with different parameters. 
It allows us to create objects in different ways. 
For example, we can create one constructor with no arguments and another with two arguments to initialize values. 
The correct constructor is called depending on how the object is created.

d. Importance of the main method
The main method in Java is the starting point of any program. 
The syntax is public static void main(String[] args). 
When we run a Java program, the JVM looks for the main method and starts executing the code from there. 
Without it, the program wonâ€™t run unless another entry point is defined.

e. Logical Operators in Java
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. The main logical operators in Java are:
&& (AND): returns true if both conditions are true
|| (OR): returns true if at least one condition is true
! (NOT): reverses the boolean value
They are mostly used in conditions and loops to make decisions.

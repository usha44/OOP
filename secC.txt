a. final keyword
The final keyword in Java is used to make something constant. 
If we use final with a variable, its value can not be changed. 
If we use it with a method, it can not be overridden, and with a class, it can not be inherited.
Example: final int x = 10; means x can not be changed.

b. Getter and Setter Methods
Getter and Setter methods are used to get and set values of private variables in a class. 
They help in hiding the data (encapsulation). 
The getter method returns the value, and the setter method updates it.
Example: getName() to get a name and setName() to set it.

c. Inheritance
Inheritance is a concept where one class can use the features (like variables and methods) of another class. 
It helps to reuse code. We use the extends keyword to do inheritance.
Example: class Dog extends Animal means Dog gets features of Animal.

d. try-catch block
The try-catch block is used in Java to handle errors during program execution. We write risky code in try, and if it causes an error, catch runs and shows a message instead of crashing the program.
Example: try { int a = 5/0; } catch (Exception e) { }
